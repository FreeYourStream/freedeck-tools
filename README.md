Nice tools for the Freedeck

## AutoHotKey
AutoHotKey is a little program that allows you to script and create macro's with relativly simple code. In the AutoHotKey folder you can find an
example config file with an example ahk file to see the working.

In order for the AHK script to work, you need to enable keywrapping on the arduino part.

## CAD-Files
For an nice enclosure for the Freedeck there are a couple pre made CAD files that you can print yourself on a 3D printer.
